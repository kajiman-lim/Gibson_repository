</header>


<p>
In 1958, Gibson updated the Les Paul yet again. the new model retained most of the specifications of the 1957 Goldtop, including PAF humbucker pickups,maple top, tune-o-matic bridge with a stop tailpiece or Bigsby vibrato tailpiece. The most significant change in the new models was the finish. the Goldtop color used since 1952, was replaced by the Sunburst finish already being used on Gibson's archtop acoustic and hollow electric guitars such as the J-45 model. </p>





<p>To differentiate from the earlier Goldtop model, the new Les Paul was referred to as The Les Paul Standard. Original production of the standards lasted from 1958 to 1960. Only 1,700 of these early models were made and have subsequently become highly collectible. </p>



<p>Original production ended when, in 1961, Gibson redesigned the Les Paul to feature a &quot;double cutaway&quot; body which has subsequently become the Gibson SG. Due to high demand, Gibson resumed production of Les Paul Standards in 1968. Today, the Gibson Les Paul Standard has BurstBucker pickups on the Vintage Original Spec models and Burstbucker Pro on the lower end models bearing the 'Standard' name.</p>


<p>
In the 80s Gibson also sold a limited number of Les Paul carrying Kahler tremolos.</p>
