	<h2>Goldtop (1952–1958)</h2>
</div>

<p>
The 1952 Les Paul featured two P-90 single coil pickups, and a one-piece, 'trapeze'-style bridge and tailpiece, with strings that were fitted under (instead of over) a steel stop-bar.  The weight and the tonal characteristics of the Les Paul were largely due to the mahogany and maple construction: maple is a hard and quite heavy wood, but was restricted to a cap over somewhat lighter mahogany, to keep weight under control.</p>


<p>In addition, the early 1952 Les Pauls were never issued serial numbers, did not have bound bodies, and are considered by some as &quot;LP Model prototypes&quot;. However, the later 1952 Les Pauls were issued serial numbers and also came with bound bodies. Interestingly, the design scheme of some of these early models varied. For instance, some of the Les Pauls of this issue were fitted with black covered P90 pickups instead of the creme colored plastic covers that are associated with this guitar, even today. Of note, these early models, nicknamed &quot;Goldtops&quot;, have begun to gain the interest of collectors, and subsequently, the associated nostalgic value of this instrument is increasing. </p>
