	<h2>Special (1955–1960)</h2>
</header>

<p>The Les Paul Special was released in 1955, featuring two soapbar P-90 single coil pickups, finished in a TV Yellow variation (but not called a TV model).</p>


<p>In 1959, the Special was given the same new double-cutaway body shape that the Junior and the TV received in 1958. However, when the new design was applied to the two-pickup Special, the cavity for the neck pickup overlapped with the neck-to-body joint. This weakened the joint to the point that the neck could break after only moderate handling. The problem was soon resolved when Gibson's designers moved the neck pickup farther down the body, producing a stronger joint and eradicating the breakage problem.</p>


<p>This stabilized version of the Special is currently offered only by Gibson's Custom Shop in the &quot;VOS&quot; series in TV Yellow.</p>
